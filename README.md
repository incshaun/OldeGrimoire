The project files to accompany the book: Ye Olde Grimoire of Components for Augmented Reality Systems

A PDF copy of the book is included as part of this repository. The current version is an intermediate draft. Since the examples age rapidly as the technology updates, this version is being made available for anyone who would like to benefit from the material and components included.

GitHub does limit the bandwidth available, so if the PDF copy is not available here then try this backup link: https://alpha.alphasoft.org/books/arsystems.pdf

These examples do not include third party supporting software. Instructions for adding these are included as part of the description of each component in the book.
